This dataset is used to recognize alphabets A to Z that can transcribe texts from paper to digital format. It has 20000 rows and 17 columns the predictor variable is “letter” which are letters from A to Z. The other 16 features consist of a matrix (a *b) of pixels, where a and b depend on the size and resolution of the original image. Each pixel has numeric values, higher values represent the presence of dense 'ink'. In the pixels where nothing is written, the pixel value is 0. If the pixel has a positive numeric value, it is called on else it is called off.
